# Logo-identification
Logo detection and identification using heuristic based method

A blackhat morphological operation is applied to the blurred, grayscale image.A blackhat operator is used to reveal dark regions against light backgrounds and compute the gradient magnitude representation of the blackhat image using the Scharr operator. 
The Scharr along the x-axis of the blackhat image, reveal regions of the image that only dark against a light background and  vertical changes in the gradient. The gradient image scale back into the range [0, 255] using min/max scaling.
A closing operation using rectangular kernel , is meant to close gaps in between the characters.Otsuâ€™s method is applied to automatically threshold the image. Another closing operation using square kernel, is used to close gaps between the individual lines. A series of erosions are performed to break apart connected components that may have been joined during the closing operation and to remove small blobs that are irrelevant.The final step is to find the contours in thresholded image and use contour properties to identify the logo. Compute contours and sort them based on the size and the largest contour are first in the list. Looping the contour to compute two properties: the aspect ratio and the coverage ratio. The aspect ratio is simply the width of the bounding box divided by the height. The coverage ratio is the width of the bounding box divided by the width of the actual image.
